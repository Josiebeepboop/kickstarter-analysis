## Overview of Project
The client, Louise, is an up-and-coming playwright who crowdfunded her latest play, "Fever". Using data from previous crowdfunding campaigns, she came very close to meeting her funding goal. She would like to finetune the data to be able to conduct an even more successful crowdfunding campaign for her next play.

### Purpose
Using data from previous crowdfunding campaign, we need to determine how different campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This information will subsequently be used to help plan the next crowdfunding campaign.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The summer months (May, June, July) seem to be the best months to conduct a campaign. The data also seems to suggest that the period between Oct, Nov, Dec, and Jan are not the best to launch a crowdfunding initiative.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
